# Predicting Semiconducotor(yes i know typo) properties of grouop 13 metal oxides (kaggle competition)
[competition link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nomad2018-predict-transparent-conductors)

Competition aims to predict the formation energy (which is an indication of the stability of a new material) and the bandgap energy (which is an indication of the potential for transparency over the visible range).

## What i done
### I did heck lot of feature engineering - (bond angles, bond dihedrals, bond lengths, energies, elemental properties and their distributions)

# CV error : 0.0485
